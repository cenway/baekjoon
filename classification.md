Notes:
- I copied files into the category folders instead of deleting originals to avoid accidental data loss.
- You asked to commit to the main branch; these files will be added on master.
- If you prefer moving (removing originals) or creating a separate branch + PR instead, tell me and I will update accordingly.

Please add or change categories if you'd like different grouping.

End of request.
